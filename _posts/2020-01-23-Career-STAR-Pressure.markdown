## STAR Interview

# When have you handled huge pressure in a work-related situation?

In my previous job a project manager left unexpectedly. He had been responsible for a project that was for factory production. I was in the factory as 24/7 debugging staff. But, requirements were changing every day, and we needed to follow up. So I decided to take that responsibility with ownership mind set. To be honest, I prefer to work under pressure and I saw this as an opportunity to help out the company in their hour of need. I joined client meeting to make a daily goal and listed tasks what we have to do then distributed it to project members. It was tough going because I had to handle hardware and software at the same time. But I put in the extra hours work needed and I am pleased to say I managed to get the project finished on time and stable. R&D manager was thrilled with my work ethic and effort, and he promoted me as a manager of UI team because of commitment and dedication for the important project.
