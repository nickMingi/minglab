# Craps

Basics: One player(shooter) rolls two dice

The shooter is a winner if they roll a sum of 7 or 11 (natural)

The shooter loses if they roll sum of 2, 3 or 12(craps)

If the shooter fails to roll a natural or craps, then the sum they roll becomes the so called point

The shooter then begins on a series of rolls to either roll the point again and win(or pass) or roll a 7 and lose(don't pass)

The shooter continues to roll until one of these outcomes occurs

# Street craps

Betting that the shooter wins is called betting the pass line
and betting the shooter loses is called betting the don't pass line.

Since there is no house, someone must be willing to take the bet

In street craps it is an advantage to bet against the shooter

# Casino craps

It's the common to change the initial roll of double 6 from a losing
roll to a push, neither a win or a loss. Shooter loses along with those
betting on the pass line, those betting along the don't pass line receive no payment, their bet is returned to them.
