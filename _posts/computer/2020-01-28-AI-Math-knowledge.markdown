# Sample Questions

1. Which of the following expressions is always equivalent to P(B|A)P(A)
    - P(A U B)
    - P(A|B)
    - P(A)P(B)
    - P(A And B)

2. A disease that occurs in 1% of the population has a test with a 3% false positive rate and a 6% false negative rate. If the test comes back positive for a random member of the population, what's the probability they have the disease?
    - 24%
    - 94%
    - 9%
    - 97%

3. When using a support vector machine on a training set with two classes, what's the minimum possible number of support vectors?
    - 0
    - 1
    - 2
    - Depends on the dimension of the input data

4. Which of the following assumptions does the Naive Bayes algorithm make?
    - The input features are linearly independent
    - The input features are conditionally independent
    - The test data is linearly separable
    - The test data is normally distributed

5. Which of the following expressions defines the variance of a random variable X?
    - E[X-E[X]^2
    - E[X^2-E[X]]
    - E[X-E[X]^2]
    - E[X-E[X]]

6. Which if the following is an application of singular value decomposition?
    - Inverting a singular matrix
    - Converting a matrix into Jordan form
    - Finding a low-rank approximation of a matrix
    - Solving an overdetermined system of linear equations

7. Given the task of finding words which share a common prefix with a given word, which data structure would have the optimal expected asymptotic performance?
    - binary tree
    - sorted array
    - hash set
    - trie

8. Which of the following approaches will help reduce overfitting?
    - Switch to a model with more parameters
    - Use a smaller training set
    - Reduce the learning rate during gradient descent
    - Add a regularization term to the cost function

9. Which of the following approaches would give the best tradeoff between speed and accuracy when calculating the product of many probabilities?
    - Use the log-sum-exp trick
    - Use the Fourier transform trick
    - Use a single-precision floating point type(float or float32)
    - Use an arbitrary precision decimal type(BigDecimal in Java)

10. Which of the following random variables cannot reasonably be considered "llD"?
    - Repeatedly drawing,without replacement,from a deck of cards
    - Repeatedly flipping a fair coin
    - Repeatedly choosing a direction to move during an unbiased random walk
    - Repeatedly flipping a biased coin that comes up heads with probability .7

11. In a random forest classifier, which of the following choices involves randomness?
    - Choosing which trees to discard during inference
    - Choosing which loss function to use
    - Choosing which branch to follow at a given node
    - Choosing which subset of features to use for a given tree

12. In general, how does the introduction of "regularization" affect a cost function?
    - It doesn't affect the cost function at all
    - It ensures that the cost function is convex
    - It penalizes large parameter values
    - It adds a term to account for Gaussian noise
