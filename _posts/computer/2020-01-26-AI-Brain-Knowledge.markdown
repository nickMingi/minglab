## Brain

Neurons -> comes from 
- Dendritic arbor
- Cell body
- Axon
		   It connects with your body by Synapses (Connection points) 
		   Communicate with each other chemical signal Neurotransmitters
		   Released at the end of Axon making electric spiked called Action potential
		   Cell accepts possible signal from the point then action is triggered 
		   It can be detected by inserting electrode represented by neuron. 

Whatever you feel, see, hear is possible neuron spikes. 

# Goals
- Increase by orders of magnitude the number of neurons you can read from and write to in safe, long-lasting ways.
- At each stage, produce devices that serve critical unmet medical needs of patients.
- Make it as simple and automated as LASIK.

Information ¡°Difference makes a difference¡± 

How far electrode can be installed from the neuron? It is 60um

They want it 
- Completely wireless
- Years to decades lifetime
- Practical bandwidth
- Usable at home
