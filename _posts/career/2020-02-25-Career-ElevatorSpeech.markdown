## Elevator Speech

- Hi, my name is Mingi, graduating Dakota State University on this May. I have three years of full time work experience mostly developing desktop application and eventually managing project. I'm looking for a job that will put my IT skills as a developer to work. My top 5 strengths are Focus, Futuristic, Competition, Input, Strategic and also I'm a good team player with leadership.

# Element of Elevator Speech
- Should be brief(30s - 60s)
- You need to be persuasive
- Share your skills
- Practice, Practice, Practice
- Be positive and flexible
- Mention your goals
- Know your audiences and speak to them
- Have a business card ready
- Don't speak too fast
- Avoid rambling
- Don't frown, or speak in a monotone way
- Don't restrict yourself to a single elevator pitch

# Another Example

1. I recently graduated from college with a degree in communications. I worked on the college newspaper as a reporter, and eventually, as the editor of the arts section. I'm looking for a job that will put my skills as a journalist to work.

2. I have a decade's worth of experience in accounting, working primarily with small and midsize firms. If your company is ever in need of an extra set of hands, I'd be thrilled to consult.

3. My name is Bob, and after years of working at other dentists' offices, I'm taking the plunge and opening my own office. If you know anyone who's looking for a new dentist, I hope you'll send them my way!

4. I create illustrations for websites and brands. My passion is coming up with creative ways to express a message, and drawing illustrations that people share on social media.

5. I'm a lawyer with the government, based out of D.C. I grew up in Ohio, though, and I'm looking to relocate closer to my roots, and join a family-friendly firm. I specialize in labor law and worked for ABC firm before joining the government

6. My name is sarah, and I run a turcking company. It's a family-owned business, and we think the personal touch makes a big difference to our customers. Not only do we guarantee on-time delivery, but my father and I personally answer the phones, not an automated systems.
