## Behavioral-based questions

# Tell me about a time when you were faced with a problem that had a number of possible solutions

# When did you take a risk, make a mistake, or fail? How did you respond, and how did you grow from that experience?

# Describe a time you took the lead on a project

# What you do when you needed to motivate a group of individuals or promote collaboration on a particular project?

# How have you leveraged data to develop a strategy?
