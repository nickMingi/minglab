## STAR Interview

# Can you tell me about a mistake you made at work and how you handled it?

Yes, One particular time I was started my first career without team members in nuclear company. I made a mistake that deleting a table from the database by accident. As soon as I noticed I had made the mistake, I informed everyone to stop working with database related work as I feel honesty and integrity are essential in a situation like this. Whilst there were no one who could help me out, I made a call to the company who sold the program with server to my company. I asked for an advice, how I can recover the data. He taught me how to restore backup date so I followed his instruction. But I realized that there was a gap between back-up data and today. I apologized to everyone then I set daily back-up time to make sure I did not make the same mistake again. Through my mistake, I covered risk that of company. Because the back-up time was long. And realized how important back-up is.
