## Interview Questions

# Why do you want to work in our company?
- I like


# What do you know about our company?
- I know

# What project have you done? (most impressive)
- I have done several projects but I remember Prism inspector project the most. I had to analyze user requirements, to design the SW architecture and to develop whole SW. It was Prism Inspector which uses cameras, laser, I2C and motors. The program was developed by C# windows form application. I designed UML as OOP as possible for the program to efficiently develop architecture. Equipment program should be simple but enable to control all the parts. UI Design was one of the key point for the project. I considered scalability and reuseability while developing. I implemented one Prisminspector class which has several composite properties(motor,I2c,cameras). I struggled developing I2C communication because previous practice was developed in C++ and different environment. I needed to know an electrical circuit and oscilloscope to catch problem I'm facing with.

# What work have you done?
- I worked in nuclear energy company to develop dose evaluation & maintenance program for the first professional experience. It has developed in node.js environment. I liked to modify program as user's request. Its satisfaction from achievement made me more hunger for advanced skills. After that, I worked in equipment company to learn equipment control especially I2C communication. Facing real-time modification was one of the difficult task for this job because equipment should not be stopped for their production

# How do you work best, both as an individual and as part of a team?
- I work better with team members because I could solve the problem with them if I'm struggling. It means I can increase efficiency of work. I believe each team member has a great point ex) let's say there are team members A,B,C A is strong at math, B is strong at communication and C has creative idea. What I need is asking them for help with clear question. I would ask A for help if I want to confirm my expected calculation. I would ask B for help if I have to co-work with other company. I would ask C for help if I want to get advice on SW architecture design.

# What challenges have you faced at school or at work and how did you overcome them?
