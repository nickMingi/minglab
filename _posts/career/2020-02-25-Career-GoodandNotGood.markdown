# What I am good at
- I'm good at Problem solving, making strategy. I have an experience reducing down time of production by making proper strategy. I was working as c++ program debugging staff in the factory, and our production efficiency was pretty low so we had to come up with the solution. To find out the root-cause I analyzed the log and finally figured out the gap between loading and unloading was huge. After that, we could add sensor at both loader and unloader side. Eventually, modified software to run production continuosly. It made improvement of production efficiency by 40% higher. My top five strengths are input, futuristic, strategy, focus, competition but also I'm a good team player with responsibility and leadership.

# What I am not good at
- While I'm a challenger who likes to try new things, I'm not good at repeatitive work. Since developing a program is always a challenging I didn't have difficult time with most of the past work but sometimes there is a task like copy and paste. If I face this kind of task, I try to find better way to solve it if there is any solution. Other than that, I finish it quickly and find another task that I can do since I'm a self-starter.
