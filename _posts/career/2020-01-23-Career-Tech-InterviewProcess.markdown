## Processes Of Tech Interview

1. Clarify the questions
- In this case, the question is relatively straightforward: I understand that I need to write a function that takes in an array and returns an array that has been manipulated.
2. Come up with a brute-force solution
- This is not optimal solution, should I think about more efficient way?
3. Think of small test cases, including edge cases
- What if input is empty?
- What if input is just one?
- What if input is N?
4. Test your solution using the test cases you come up with earlier
- Alternative solution?
- Even more efficient way?
- Think with simpler examples -> try noticing a pattern
- Use some visualization
- Test your solution on a few examples
- Find time complexity
- Find space complexity
- I think I know the concept of it, Can I start coding?
