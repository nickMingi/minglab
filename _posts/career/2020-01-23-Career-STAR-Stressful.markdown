## STAR Interview

# Can you describe a stressful situation and how you handled it?

Whilst working in the army as a military police, my task was checking ID of passengers to judge if he is okay to get in the base or not. Suddenly one car just passed me without my consent. And in 0.5 second, I intuitively decided to take responsibility of blocking the second barrier if his car get damaged or not. Because he did not get my approval to get in. The car was damaged by barrier, and I and my colleague approached him with armed. He was yelling us but we followed the principle. Since, I activated the barrier, tank was coming for this. Eventually, he was investigated by police and military police and I got the reward from my team for right action. I believe I handled this situation with confidence and resilience, and although it was stressful at times, I was determined to follow guarding gate procedures to ensure everyone was safe.
