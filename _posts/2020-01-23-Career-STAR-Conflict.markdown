## STAR INTERVIEW

# Can you give an example of how you dealt with conflict in the workplace?

Yes I can. In my previous job as a User Interface team manager, there was one particular work colleague who seemed to dislike me. She was talking about me in my back that I rejects the idea all the time. And expressed her idea is the best in front of the team members. I decided to tackle the situation in a calm manner. However, before I approached her to discuss the situation, I needed to decide what it was I wanted to achieve from the discussion. I understand we can't always get on with everyone in a work place environment, but the problem with this type of situation is it can be detrimental to the organization as a whole. On that basis, I wanted to first of all try and see if there was anything I was doing that irritated her, before trying to reach a constructive solution to the problem. Once I had determined my goal, I approached her whilst she was on her own and asked her if we could have a private discussion away from other office workers. We sat down in a room away from everyone else and explained my concerns with regards to how I felt she was treating me. I also asked her if there was anything I was doing that irritated her. Her initial reaction was extremely defensive, but I maintained my position and repeated my feelings with regards to how she was treating me in a calm and non-confrontational manner.
