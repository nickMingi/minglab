# Cover Letter

```
Hello, my name is Mingi Hong. Originally from South Korea.
I'm majoring computer science at Dakota State University.
and expecting to graduate on May 2020. I have three years of
full time work experience. My job was mostly developing desktop
application using several languages including PHP, C#, C++.
Recently, I started studying Python since I studied AI as well

Most impressive experience was developing software for factory
production. I went to japan so that I could be available 24/7
debugging if production goes something wrong. And I joined 
production meeting to improve efficiency for production.

I took AI class last fall semester and I really liked the math
inside of it. So, before graduated, I will work for AI professor
as an assistant.

I'm good at learning new things and used to work in fast-faced
work environment. One of my best soft skill is leadership.
I like to lead project and make it done before dead-line.

I would love the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute
to your software team. Thank you in advance for your consideration
and I look forward to hearing from you

All the best,
Mingi Hong.

# Leadership Role

```
When I was working at factory in Japan
I was the only person who can speak english
so I had to be involved production meeting
to improve UPH(unit per hour) and to reduce
downtime of equipment.
Even though I was studying and working 
at the same time, I volunteered to take
critical role in production to safely 
finish our project. 
To find the root cause of downtime, I had to
analyze the log and I found the gap between
loading and unloading. 
First reason of gap is that operator's low attention.
equipment was idle for a long time since another load
was not started which is run by operator.
To prevent this, we need to equip sensor to alert 
process will be done soon. But also, eventually we
come up with continuous production without ending
each production. It helped improvement of 40% of
production efficiency.
As a result, our project was successful but I got
F from school classes. I showed my dedication to my
manager during the project, and I was promoted as
User Interface Manager.

# Club Activity

```
To be engaged in school activity, I tried several club activities including
Korean Language Club. Since I'm from South Korea, club's people wanted me to
Join their club to do language exchange. I could ask them about english expressions
That I don't understand and I could teach them some Korean words that
They want to know. It was fun and meaningful time at the same time.
