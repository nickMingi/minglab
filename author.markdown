# Cover Letter

```
Hello, my name is Mingi Hong. Originally from South Korea.
I'm majoring computer science at Dakota State University.
and expecting to graduate on May 2020. I have three years of
full time work experience. My job was mostly developing desktop
application using several languages including PHP, C#, C++.
Recently, I started studying Python since I studied AI as well

Most impressive experience was developing software for factory
production. I went to japan so that I could be available 24/7
debugging if production goes something wrong. And I joined 
production meeting to improve efficiency for production.

I took AI class last fall semester and I really liked the math
inside of it. So, before graduated, I will work for AI professor
as an assistant.

I'm good at learning new things and used to work in fast-faced
work environment. One of my best soft skill is leadership.
I like to lead project and make it done before dead-line.

I would love the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute
to your software team. Thank you in advance for your consideration
and I look forward to hearing from you

All the best,
Mingi Hong.
